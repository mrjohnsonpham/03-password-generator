# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
Given the user needs a new secure password
when they click the button to generate a new password will be created. 

1. First the user will be prompted for the length of the password.
The user will choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
2. They will be reprompted asking to choose a valid input if it not within 8 characters or no more than 128 characters
3. The user will than be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
which follows through a loop of different confirm questions that include asking if they prefer:
lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
4. The user will elect which criteria to include in for their new generated password.
This then helps to validated the requirement necessary in order to create their newly trusted password.
5. Once all prompts are answered, a password is generated that will match the selected criteria
which will create the new generated password in the card-body.
